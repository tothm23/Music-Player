# Music-Player
Plays music from Google Drive
# Description
This project contains about **200 music** with edm, hell and normal theme. The music is playable, pausable and the next, previous song is choosable with the buttons. I decorated the buttons with [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons.
# Structure and run
This project was created with pure **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** code without any framework. The JavaScript code fetched the data from my NoSQL type database (**JSON**), that connect to the songs source (Google Drive). I used the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) the coding and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to deploying.
